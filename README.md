# Task 7: Creating Views

## Objective
To learn how to create, use, and manage SQL Views for abstraction, security, and reusable query logic.

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench  
- DB Browser for SQLite

## What I Did
- Created sample tables (Customers, Orders, Products).
- Inserted sample data.
- Wrote SQL queries to:
  - Create simple and complex views using `CREATE VIEW`
  - Update data through updatable views
  - Use views for data abstraction and restricted access
  - Create views using joins
  - Query views like normal tables
- Added examples of:
  - Dropping views
  - Using `WITH CHECK OPTION`
- Saved all queries inside **task7.sql**
- Added screenshots of view creation and outputs.

## Key Concepts Covered
- What is a view?
- Updatable vs non-updatable views
- Materialized view (concept)
- Difference between table and view
- How to drop a view
- Indexed views (concept)
- Securing data with views
- Limitations of views
- Using `WITH CHECK OPTION`

## Files Included
- `task7.sql` – All SQL Queries
- `README.md`
- `screenshots/` folder

## Outcome
Understanding how SQL views improve abstraction, simplify complex queries, and enhance data security.
